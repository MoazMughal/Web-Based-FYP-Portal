University receives scholarships from different donors and distributes them among students. The goal of this project is to
assist the university and students in maintaining and getting information about scholarships. There will be three main
stakeholders of the system (1) Donors (2) Students, and (3) Scholarship administrators. Donors should be able to provide
information about the amount they want to donate, duration, eligibility criteria, etc. The students will be able to provide
their credentials and apply for the scholarships. The scholarship administrators will manage the distribution of the
scholarships. The system would also be able to generate reports for administrators and donors. Technologies: Web
