Web chat is quite an important part of any tech support department. We are now living in a global village. A company can
have clients from anywhere. It's quite difficult for any tech guy to text chat and voice chat with other language speaking
customers. We want a system where a chat system should handle all the language related problems. Customer will text
chat or voice chat in his own language and the tech guy will communicate on his own. The system will handle all the
language translations, in real time, including text and voice, automatically, at the server end. Google translation api free
version is recommended for use.
