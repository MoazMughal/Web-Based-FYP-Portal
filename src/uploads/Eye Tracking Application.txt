Develop an eye tracking application that can detect Autism where affected person/child does not give/maintain eye contact
with other individuals. Autism is a neurological developmental disorder where a person struggles to maintain eye contact,
social interaction, communication challenges along with other developmental delays. Early intervention can play a
significant role in childâ€™s development; hence, early detection is very important. Symptoms usually start at the age of 6
month but due to the lack of understanding, parents misinterpret it and wait for its official diagnosis till the age of 3 years
which misses his early years of learning. Detecting autism through infantâ€™s eye tracking (eye movement patterns and
focus areas) can be a helpful tool to start therapies as early as possible. There is a need of an eye tracking application that
can capture eye movements and focus areas while watching a video/an image for specific time frame. These movements
can then be compared with typical individual eye movement patterns. Machine learning model like neural networks can be
used for training and classification of typical/non typical individuals.
