Local issues are highlighted in national newspapers, but they are not communicated properly to the relevant
department(s). This purpose of this project is to automatically extract the local issues from national newspapers, identify
type of issues based on their contents and communicate to relevant department(s) and stakeholders. The system will also
keep track of the issue(s) to see whether they are resolved by the relevant department within prescribed time.
