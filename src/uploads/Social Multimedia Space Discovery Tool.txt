Social media allows users to create, share, and exchange multimedia content over the web via virtual communities, i.e.,
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc. The content generated via social media sites are multimedia-based,
diverse, and heterogeneous. The users want to interact with the multimedia content in an integrated and usable way. The
Social media aggregator tools allow users to collate posts and updates on specific topics via social media feeds. However,
the discovery of contents is cumbersome. In this project, the student will design and develop an interactive multimediabased social space discover tool to explore multimedia-based content. The tool will (i) aggregate the social media content
belonging to different media formats from multiple sources, (ii) manage the archived multimedia contents, and (iii) provide
the exploration of multimedia content. The objective of the tool is to provide usable interaction with multimedia content in
an integrated, interactive, and usable way.
