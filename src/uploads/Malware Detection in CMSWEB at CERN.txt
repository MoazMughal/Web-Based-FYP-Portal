The CMS experiment relies extensively on the CMSWEB cluster, which leverages Kubernetes ("k8s") technology, an opensource system designed for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This
project is geared toward the development of a service that specializes in employing machine/deep learning techniques for
malware detection within network streams in the CMSWEB environment. Within CMSWEB, frontends are Apache-based and
incorporate robust x.509 authentication protocols to ensure user authorization. However, even with stringent access
controls, there remains the potential for malware to infiltrate the CMSWEB infrastructure. Thus, the primary objective of
this project is to establish a new service that systematically examines network streams, utilizing advanced
machine/learning learning methodologies, with the goal of actively identifying and blocking any malware threats attempting
to breach our infrastructure. This initiative is pivotal in enhancing the security posture of the CMSWEB cluster with a
particular focus on machine/deep learning. By harnessing Kubernetes technology and Apache's x.509 authentication in
conjunction with machine/deep learning capabilities, we aspire to create a seamless, effective solution. This solution will
not only bolster our defen
