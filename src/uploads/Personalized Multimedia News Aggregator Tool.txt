The news aggregator tool gathers the latest news from various sources and aggregates the news-related content over a
single location. The aggregated news content is multimedia-based since it belongs to different media formats (i.e., HTML
web pages, video clips, images, audio, etc.). The personalized news aggregator tool may satisfy the news information
needs of the users in a unified way. In this project, the student will design and develop a multimedia news aggregator tool
that considers the specific information needs of the news users and aggregate the multimedia-based news content
belonging to different media formats (i.e., HTML text, videos, image, audio, etc.) on the interested topic from several
sources. The objective is to provide a usable and interactive exploration of the user's desired multimedia-based news
content in personalized settings.
