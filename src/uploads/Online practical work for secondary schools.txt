It has become difficult for the schools to financially manage effective and operational laboratories where they let their
students do the practical stuff such as in physics and chemistry in real Lab. Environment. As a result, students hardly do
the practical work. Using computing technology, we can at least provide virtual experience of Lab. Work. For this purpose,
secondary school chemistry experiments will be the target for this project. The crucial components are the procedure to
perform, and the lab equipment to use.
Procedure for the experiment: It consists of the main task to do, and the sub tasks which may consist of actions such as
performing actions, observing actions, and actions of drawing conclusions.
Lab. Equipment: It would be available as a collection to choose from.
Practical would have two modes, i.e. Demo / Tutorial and Practice. In Demo mode, the procedure would be displayed and
would remain fixed. Accordingly, equipment from the equipmentâ€™sâ€™ collection would be selected by the system in a
predefined manner. During each step of the procedure, explanation would be provided. In practice mode, only the title of
the experiment would be given, and the student would need to frame the procedure, and the list of equipment to use. The
equipment would be manipulated in direct manipulation mode.
