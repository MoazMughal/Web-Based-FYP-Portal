Climate models are considered state-of-the-art tools for projecting future climate change under different greenhouse gas
emission scenarios. However, the outputs of these models are subject to uncertainties due to complex processes intrinsic to
the Earth's system. A bias correction approach is adopted to remove biases in various climate variables. In this proposed
work, data from multiple climate models will be bias-corrected and statistically downscaled (BCSD) to a higher resolution
over Pakistan. Additionally, a dashboard will be developed to provide a user interface for executing the complex Pythonbased BCSD code.
