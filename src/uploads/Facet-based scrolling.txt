Web browsers generally provide horizontal and vertical scroll bars based upon the amount of content. While interacting
with Web content, users feel that there should be multiple axes for scrolling, e.g. if a user is reading a book online then
scrolling based only upon figures, tables, examples, citations etc. would greatly enhance the reading experience. For this
purpose, the content would need to be processed for facet-based representation, and then appropriate UI widgets would
need to be developed.
