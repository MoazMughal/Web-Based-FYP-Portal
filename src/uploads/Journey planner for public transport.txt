People often face challenges while travelling using public transport due to unavailability of detailed information about public
transport. The goal of this project is to facilitate users in availing public transport. Given the schedule and routes of public
transport, the user will provide their origin and destination and the system will display the routes available to the user. The
routes will be ranked or filtered based on different criteria, like minimum fare, minimum vehicle changes, fastest route, etc.
