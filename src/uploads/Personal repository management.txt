Users tend to download multiple copies of the same document over time. Sometimes, they name it differently, but the
contents are the same. Consequently, our repositories are filled with redundant documents which leads to storage, search,
and performance issues. An App / tool is required that should help users in avoiding / handling such unnecessary copies,
downloads etc. Important factors for assessing the duplicates are metadata of the resource as well as its contents. App
should also provide visualization to differentiate between various copies so that user may decide to delete / retain the
resource in a well-informed manner. That would also reduce the action of manually going through various copies
