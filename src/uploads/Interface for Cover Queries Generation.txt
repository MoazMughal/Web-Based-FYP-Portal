Internet become a fundamental right of humans nowadays. One of the most frequent activities on the internet is searching
for precise information need. Web Search Engines (WSE) are the only online solution to find the precise information
needed. WSE maintains logs of user searches and can identify user age, region, profession, and interest. This is not
desirable for a sensitive organization. There is a need to hide sensitive user keywords in such a way that WSE is not able to
predict correctly. After the collection of sensitive terms, deep fake cover queries will be generated to dilute internet traffic
which as a result will make it challenging for WSE to predict the intent of users based on sensitive queries. This will
improve the cyber / privacy protection of any organization and hide R&D interest and intent.
