Teaching in many countries is being done online, either partially or fully. Still, mostly there is a teacher at the other end. It
is high time to think about automating the role of teacher as well, in subject areas where it is possible and feasible to do
so. This is also appealing because of abundant bandwidth and computing facilities available to the users. As a first attempt,
target is to realize one or two specific chapters from high school Mathâ€™s book such as number system, basic arithmetic,
or differentiation. A number of APIs also exist which can be extended for the purpose. The system should have multiple
modes namely monologue, and dialogue. In dialogue mode the delivery would correspond with the questions asked by the
students.
