Pakistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Information related to future projections of climate
change under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios is crucial for developing and implementing policies to mitigate
the impacts of future climate change. This project aims to translate information from coarse-resolution climate models to
the meteorological station level using a state-of-the-art statistical downscaling approach for multiple climate variables.
Additionally, a user-friendly climate dashboard will be developed, allowing for the selection and display of various climate
variables for each station. In essence, our goal is to convert large-scale climate data models into localized station-level
insights, offering valuable information for climate analysis and decision-making.
