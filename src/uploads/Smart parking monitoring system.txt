The goal of the project is to assist people in parking their vehicles. Designated parking areas will be monitored via cameras
to count the number of positions of free and available parking slots. An admin dashboard will enable the administrator to
add parking spaces and mark parking slots. The user dashboard/app will allow them to see the free slots. There should be
a provision to reserve a slot on payment basis. There should be a mechanism to identify vehicles which are parked illegally
(without payment). Recommended technologies: OpenCV, Web Development.
